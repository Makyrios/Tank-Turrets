# Tank-Turrets

First game made during AlphaNova course. Made in team of 3 people.

## Description:

When you start the game, we get to the menu where we can select the game mode: 

Tank game mode (click on the tank), where we play as a tank. You can set the number of enemies to spawn, this can be done in the turret spawner, which is located in the middle of the map, you select a variable Numbers To Spawn, set the desired number, and the number you specified, will randomly spawn at predetermined points on the map. Spawn is random every time, i.e, it may be that at a certain point on the next launch of the game there will be no turret, again, it all depends on how many spawn points are installed in the class. In the spawner you can also adjust the attack radius, fire rate, tower rotation speed, and turret damage. Player damage can be modified in the BP_Tank class.

Turret game mode (click on the turret), where we play as a turret. Same logic as a previous game mode, but with difference. You can't move, only shoot, the enemies will spawn and move to your location until you or they aren't destroyed.
Player damage can be modified in the BP_Turret class.
